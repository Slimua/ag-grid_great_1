The foundations of ag-Grid is a custom made framework designed specifically for ag-Grid. Having no dependency means ag-Grid will work with any framework — we call this framework agnostic.\n\nBeing framework agnostic allows you to choose your framework and data grid separately. It also reduces the work required when you move frameworks (e.g. moving from Angular 1 to Angular, VueJS or React to Aurelia etc.).\n\nIf you choose a data grid that is not framework agnostic (e.g. written using Angular) then you have locked into that framework. If you select a data grid you should not be locked into a framework.\n\nWe are not aware of any other data grid that is agnostic like ag-Grid.\n\nAG Grid is available as a free community edition and commercially as an Enterprise product (full support and more features).
