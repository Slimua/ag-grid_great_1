This section describes some of the shared configuration for the four filters provided by the grid - [Text Filter](/filter-text/), [Number Filter](/filter-number/), [Date Filter](/filter-date/) and [Set Filter](/filter-set/).

## Applying Provided Filters

Provided filters can be customised with Apply, Clear, Reset and Cancel buttons. This can also mean they have separate applied and un-applied Filter Models.

See [Applying Provided Filters](/filter-applying/) for more details.

## Simple Filters

There are multiple configuration options shared by the three Simple Filters - [Text Filter](/filter-text/), [Number Filter](/filter-number/) and [Date Filter](/filter-date/). This includes [Filter Parts](/filter-provided-simple/#simple-filter-parts), [Blank Cell Handling](/filter-provided-simple/#blank-cells-date-and-number-filters), [Data Updates](/filter-provided-simple/#data-updates) and [Customising Filter Placeholder Text](/filter-provided-simple/#customising-filter-placeholder-text).

See [Simple Filters](/filter-provided-simple/) for more details.
