This section covers Server-Side Sorting using the Server-Side Row Model.

## Sorting

Sorting is enabled by default in the grid and controlled via the `sortable` column definition attribute.


<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        { field: 'country'},
        // Disable sorting by sport
        { field: 'sport', sortable: false },
    ]
}
</snippet>

For more details on sorting configurations see the section on [Row Sorting](/row-sorting/).

## Server-side Sorting

The actual sorting of rows is performed on the server when using the Server-Side Row Model. When a sort is applied in the
grid a request is made for more rows via `getRows(params)` on the [Server-Side Datasource](/server-side-model-datasource/).

The request object sent to the server contains sort metadata in the `sortModel` property, an example is shown below:

```js
// Example request with sorting info
{
    sortModel: [
        { colId: 'country', sort: 'asc' },
        { colId: 'year', sort: 'desc' },
    ]
}
```

Notice in the snippet above that the `sortModel` contains an array of models for each column that has active sorts in 
the grid. The column ID and sort type can then be used by the server to perform the actual sorting.

The example below demonstrates sorting using the SSRM. Note the following:

- The server uses the metadata contained in the `sortModel` to sort the rows.
- Open the browser's dev console to view the `sortModel` supplied in the request to the datasource.
- Try single / multi-column (using <kbd>â‡§ Shift</kbd> key) sorting by clicking on column headers.

## Client-side Sorting

The Server-Side Row Model supports client-side sorting. This is achieved by enabling the property `serverSideEnableClientSideSort`.
With this property enabled, if the grid has all of the rows belonging to the impacted group, the grid can sort these rows on the client-side. This can be useful for reducing the load on the server, and improving user experience by reducing loading view time.

The example below demonstrates client-side sorting using the SSRM. Note the following:

- `cacheBlockSize` has been increased to 10,000 - this allows the first request to load every row.
- `serverSideEnableClientSideSort` is set to `true`
- When sorting any column in this example, the rows are not replaced by loading rows, and a request to the server is not made.
