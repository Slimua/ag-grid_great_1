This section provides key information for configuring and interacting with a grid. 

## Grid Options

md-include:index-javascript.md
md-include:index-angular.md
md-include:index-react.md 
md-include:index-vue.md
 
For a full list of options see: [Grid Options](grid-options).

## Grid Events

md-include:events-javascript.md
md-include:events-angular.md 
md-include:events-react.md 
md-include:events-vue.md

For a full list of events see: [Grid Events](/grid-events).

## Grid API

md-include:api-javascript.md
md-include:api-angular.md
md-include:api-react.md
md-include:api-vue.md

For a full list of api methods see: [Grid API](grid-api). 

## Grid State

As a user interacts with the grid they may change state such as filtering, sorting and column order. This state is independent of the configuration and to provide save and restore capabilities the grid enables applications to save / restore this state.

For a full list of the state properties see: [Grid State](/grid-state/).

## Grid Lifecycle
 
When working with AG Grid it is a common requirement to perform actions when the grid is first initialised, when data is first rendered and when the grid is about to be destroyed. 

For full details about how to interact with the grid at these key moments see: [Grid Lifecycle](/grid-lifecycle/).
