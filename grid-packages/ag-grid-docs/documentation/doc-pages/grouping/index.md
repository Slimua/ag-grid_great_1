## Enabling Default Row Grouping

When there is at least one active row group, a single group column containing a row grouping hierarchy will be added to
the left-hand side of the grid. To group rows by a particular column, enable the `rowGroup` column property as shown below:

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        { field: 'country', rowGroup: true },
        { field: 'year', rowGroup: true },
        { field: 'sport' },
        { field: 'total' }
    ],
}
</snippet>

In the snippet above, rows will be grouped by `country` and `year` as both column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared.

The example below demonstrates the default row grouping behaviour. Note the following:

- There are two active row groups as the supplied `country` and `year` column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared.

- A group column is added to the left-hand side of the grid as there are active row groups.

- The `country` and `year` columns are still shown in the grid (to hide set `hide=true` on their column definitions).

- The number of grouped rows is shown in parentheses at each row group level.

## Row Grouping Customisations

The previous example demonstrated the [Default Row Grouping](../grouping/#example-default-row-grouping) behavior, 
however extensive Row Grouping customisations are also possible as summarised below:

- **[Display Types](../grouping-display-types/)** - compares the different ways row groups can be displayed in the grid.
    - ***[Single Group Column](../grouping-single-group-column/)*** - a single group column is automatically added by the grid for all row groups.
    - ***[Multiple Group Columns](../grouping-multiple-group-columns/)*** - group columns are automatically added by the grid for each row group.
    - ***[Group Rows](../grouping-group-rows/)*** - group rows are automatically added by the grid containing the row groups instead of group columns.
    - ***[Custom Group Columns](../grouping-custom-group-columns/)*** - customise how row groups are displayed without using the built-in display types.
- **[Row Group Panel](../grouping-group-panel/)** - add a panel above the grid to allow users control which columns the rows are grouped by.
- **[Group Footers](../grouping-footers/)** - add group footers showing totals for each group level.
- **[Sorting / Filtering](../grouping-sorting-filtering/)** - customise the sorting and filtering row groups.
- **[Opening Groups](../grouping-opening-groups/)** - control how row groups are expanded and collapsed.
- **[Complex Objects](../grouping-complex-objects/)** - group rows using row data contains complex objects.
- **[Unbalanced Groups](../grouping-unbalanced-groups/)** - group rows when there are `null` or `undefined` group values.
