## Row Grouping Methods

The grid provides different row grouping methods out-of-the-box, as illustrated below.

To learn more about each of these row grouping methods, follow the links below:

- **[Single Group Columns](../grouping-single-group-column/)**: A single group column containing a row grouping hierarchy.
- **[Multiple Group Columns](../grouping-multiple-group-columns/)**: Separate group columns for each row group.
- **[Full Width Groups](../grouping-full-width-groups/)**: Full rows showing details about the group instead of group columns.

## Row Grouping Customisations

The default behaviour provided in the various [Row Grouping Methods](../grouping/#row-grouping-methods) will meet the 
requirements of most applications. However, extensive Row Grouping customisations are also possible. See the sections
below for more details:

- **[Group Customisation](../grouping-customisation/)** 
- **[Sorting](../grouping-sorting/)**
- **[Filtering](../grouping-filtering/)**
- **[Group Footers](../grouping-footers/)**
- **[Provided Groups](../grouping-provided-groups/)**

## Grid Grouping Properties
