                        <article>
                            <p>
                                At AG Grid, our mission is simple: <strong>Build the best datagrid in the world</strong>
                                .
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Born out of frustration with existing solutions, <strong>AG Grid</strong> evolved from a
                                side project to becoming the leading JavaScript datagrid on the market. We are a company
                                built by developers for developers, and - true to our roots - we offer{' '}
                                <strong>AG Grid Community</strong>: a free and open-source project that delivers world
                                class grid performance. <strong>AG Grid Enterprise</strong> is our commercially-licensed
                                offering which has enjoyed widespread adoption and facilitates us to keep delivering on
                                our mission.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our story is proof that necessity is the mother of invention. During his time working in
                                London-based financial institutions, <strong>Niall Crosby</strong> - founder and CEO -
                                struggled to find any datagrid component that could deliver the performance required in
                                tandem with a complete feature list. This struggle ultimately led Niall to pulling out
                                the keyboard one Christmas holiday period and starting <strong>AG Grid</strong> as a
                                side project. This was then released as open source and quickly developed a following.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Niall found himself having to devote considerable time and effort to maintaining
                                <strong> AG Grid</strong>, even fielding feature requests from users. It became apparent
                                that this thing had legs - and the idea of <strong>AG Grid Enterprise</strong> took seed
                                in Niall’s mind. A little over one year after the project started the first commercial
                                version was launched.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today, <strong>AG Grid</strong> is a self-funded, bootstrapped company with thousands of
                                customers globally. Our product has resonated in the market - as our users face the same
                                challenges Niall did - and this has been central to our rapid growth. And we’re not
                                stopping here: we are working on the next great features to continue our mission.

                        <h2>Our Principles</h2>

                        <article>
                            <p>
                                We believe that a datagrid should be agnostic to the framework that developers choose.
                                This allows flexibility and future-proofs your development. This is also where the 'ag'
                                in <strong>AG Grid </strong>
                                comes from.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our experience is in building Enterprise applications: we know that the datagrid is at
                                the core of an Enterprise application, and needs to deliver performance and a rich
                                feature set.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We give away what others charge for. <strong>AG Grid Community</strong> provides all of
                                the features of our competition. We only charge when we go above and beyond, with
                                features that other grids don’t provide.
