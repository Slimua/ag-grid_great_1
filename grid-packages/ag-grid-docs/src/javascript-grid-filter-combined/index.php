<h1 class="heading-enterprise">Combined Filter</h1>

<p class="lead">
    The Combined Filter allows <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-provided/">Provided Filters</a> or
    <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-component/">Custom Filters</a>  to be combined on the same column. This
    provides greater flexibility when filtering data in the grid.
</p>

<h2>Enabling the Combined Filter</h2>

<p>
    To use a Combined Filter, specify the following in your Column Definition:
</p>

<?= createSnippet(<<<SNIPPET
// ColDef
{
    filter: 'agCombinedColumnFilter'
}
SNIPPET
) ?>

<p>
    By default the Combined Filter will show a <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-text/">Text Filter</a>
    combined with a <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-set/">Set Filter</a>, but you can specify which filters
    you would like to combine in the <code>filters</code> array.
</p>

<p>
    The example below shows the Combined Filter in action. Note the following:
</p>

<ul class="content">
    <li>The <strong>Athlete</strong> has a Combined Filter with default behaviour.</li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Country</strong>, <strong>Gold</strong> and <strong>Date</strong> columns have Combined Filters with
        the type of the wrapped filter stated explicitly, using the
        <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-text/">Text</a>,
        <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-number/">Number</a> and
        <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-date/">Date</a> Simple Filters respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Filter params supplied to the Combined Filter will be passed to the Set Filter, but different
        <code>filterParams</code> can be supplied to the wrapped filter, as shown in the <strong>Date</strong> column.
    </li>
    <li>
        Floating filters are enabled for all columns. The floating filter reflects the active filter for that column,
        so changing whether you are using the wrapped filter or the Set Filter within a Combined Filter will change
        which floating filter is shown.
    </li>
    <li>
        We recommend setting <code>alwaysShowBothConditions</code> to <code>true</code> for provided filters to reduce
        the amount of UI movement when a user changes which filter within the Combined Filter they are interacting
        with. We have therefore shown this enabled for all columns except the <strong>Athlete</strong> column, which
        shows the default behaviour.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can print the current filter state to the console and save/restore it using the buttons at the top of the
        grid.
    </li>
</ul>

<?= grid_example('Combined Filter', 'combined-filter', 'generated', ['enterprise' => true, 'exampleHeight' => 700]) ?>

<h2>Synchronisation (currently not working - needs revision for generic approach)</h2>

<p>
    When using the <a href="../javascript-grid-client-side-model/">Client-Side Row Model</a> and filtering using the
    wrapped filter, the Set Filter will update to show the same selection as if the user had manually chosen the
    matching items in the Set Filter instead. This allows a user to use the wrapped filter as a starting point to create
    a set of values that can then be tweaked in the Set Filter.
</p>

<p>
    This synchronisation does not happen when using any other row model; instead the Set Filter will simply show
    everything as deselected when the wrapped filter is active. You can also specify this behaviour if you would prefer
    it by setting <code>suppressSynchronisation</code> in the <code>filterParams</code>:
</p>

<?= createSnippet(<<<SNIPPET
// ColDef
{
    filter: 'agCombinedColumnFilter',
    filterParams: {
        suppressSynchronisation: true,
    }
}
SNIPPET
) ?>

<p>
    The following example demonstrates synchronisation.
</p>

<ul class="content">
    <li>
        The <strong>Athlete</strong> column shows the default behaviour, where the selections in the Set Filter are
        kept in sync when the wrapped filter is used.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Country</strong> column has synchronisation disabled so the Set Filter has everything deselected
        whenever the wrapped filter is used.
    </li>
</ul>

<?= grid_example('Synchronisation', 'synchronisation', 'generated', ['enterprise' => true, 'exampleHeight' => 700, 'modules' => ['clientside', 'setfilter', 'menu']]) ?>

<h2>Concurrent Filtering</h2>

<p>
    By default, only one filter from the Combined Filter can be active at any time. If you apply any filter, all other
    filters will be reset to prevent more than one filter being active concurrently.
</p>

<p>
    If you would like all filters to be allowed at the same time, set <code>allowAllFiltersConcurrently</code> in the
    <code>filterParams</code>:
</p>

<?= createSnippet(<<<SNIPPET
// ColDef
{
    filter: 'agCombinedColumnFilter',
    filterParams: {
        allowAllFiltersConcurrently: true,
    }
}
SNIPPET
) ?>

<p>
    In this case, when more than one filter is active, the floating filter will be hidden, and synchronisation will be
    disabled automatically. The filters will be applied using AND in the same way that filters from different columns
    are combined.
</p>

<p>
    The following example demonstrates the different behaviour.
</p>

<ul class="content">
    <li>
        The <strong>Athlete</strong> column shows the default behaviour, where only one filter is allowed to be active
        at any time.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Country</strong> column is configured to allow both filters to be used at the same time.
    </li>
</ul>

<?= grid_example('Allow All Filters', 'allow-all-filters', 'generated', ['enterprise' => true, 'exampleHeight' => 700, 'modules' => ['clientside', 'setfilter', 'menu']]) ?>

<h2>Custom Filters</h2>

<p>
    You can use your own <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-custom/">Custom Filters</a> with the Combined Filter.
</p>

<p>
    The example below shows a Custom Filter in use on the <strong>Year</strong> column, combined with the grid-provided
    <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-number/">Number Filter</a>.
</p>

<?= grid_example('Custom Filters', 'custom-filter', 'vanilla', ['enterprise' => true, 'exampleHeight' => 700]) ?>

<h2>Combined Filter Parameters</h2>

<p>
    Parameters that are common to all <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-provided/">Provided Filters</a>:
</p>

<?php createDocumentationFromFile('../javascript-grid-filter-provided/providedFilters.json', 'filterParams') ?>

<p>
    Parameters that are specific to the Combined Filter:
</p>

<?php createDocumentationFromFile('combinedFilterParams.json', 'filterParams') ?>

<?php include '../documentation-main/documentation_footer.php';?>
