License files are stored here. When a new license file is ready, this is what you do:

1) Create a new file with the version of the eula in it, following
   same naming patterns as before. If it's a small change (eg typo
   or formatting) then just overwrite old file.

2) Copy contents into AG-Grid-Enterprise-License-Latest.html.
   This is what the website display when user clicks to view
   license. It's also the license that gets used by online eComm.

3) Copy file into \grid-enterprise-modules\core\LICENSE.html.
   This will then get copied into all enterprise modules during
   the build cycle.
