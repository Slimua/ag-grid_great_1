    <h2>Inline Column Drag and Drop</h2>


    <h4>Enable Inline Drag and Drop</h4>

    <p>
        Turn sorting on for the grid by enabling drag and drop via enableColReorderInline in gridOptions
    </p>

    <p>
       Simply Drag and drop columns to where you want them to appear, and the dragged column will appear on the front of the column where it is being dropped.
       Further logic may be added to calculate the middle point of the column and put the dragged column on the front or the dropped one (if lower than columnWidth/2) or at the back
    </p>
