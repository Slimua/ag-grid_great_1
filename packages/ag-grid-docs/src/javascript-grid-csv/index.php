    <h1>CSV Export</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        The data can be exported to CSV with an API call, or using the right-click context menu on the Grid.
    </p>

    <note>
        This page covers CSV-specific features. For information on how to control what data is included in the export
        and to format/transform the data as it is exported, see the <a href="../javascript-grid-export/">Export documentation</a>.
    </note>

    <h2>
        API
    </h2>

    <ul class="content">
        <li><code>gridOptions.suppressCsvExport</code>: set this Grid Property to true to disable CSV export
        <li><code>exportDataAsCsv(params)</code>: download a CSV file to the user's computer.</li>
        <li><code>getDataAsCsv(params)</code>: return a CSV string.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The params object can contain all the <a href="../javascript-grid-export/">common export options</a>, as
        well as these CSV-specific options:

    <h2>Appending header and footer content</h2>

    <p>
        The recommended way to append header and footer content is by passing an array of
        ExcelCell objects to <code>customHeader</code> or <code>customFooter</code>, as described in the
        <a href="../javascript-grid-export/">Export</a> documentation. This ensures that your
        header content is correctly escaped, and if your application also exports Excel data you
        can use the same data for both exports.</p>
    <p>
        For compatibility with earlier versions of the Grid you can also pass a string, which will be
        inserted into the CSV file without any processing. You are responsible for formatting the
        string according to the CSV standard.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Example: CSV Export Options</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><code>suppressQuotes</code> and <code>columnSeparator</code> have the effects documented above. Use the "api.getTextAsCsv()" button to see their effect,
            because changing their default values will prevent the file from opening properly in Excel</li>
        <li>With <code>customHeader=ExcelCell[][]</code>, custom content will be inserted containing commas
            and quotes. These commas and quotes will be visible when opened in Excel because they have been
            escaped properly.</li>
        <li>Setting <code>customHeader=string</code> causes a string to be inserted into the CSV file without any processing, and without
            being affected by <code>suppressQuotes</code> and <code>columnSeparator</code>. It contains commas and quotes what will not be
            visible in Excel.</li>
    </ul>
