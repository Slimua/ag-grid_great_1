# Example assets

These assets are uploaded to https://www.ag-grid.com/example-assets/ to be used by the examples in the documentation. They can be used for data files that are too big to live alongside the examples or that are used by multiple examples, images, etc. They should always be referenced using absolute URLs based on https://www.ag-grid.com/example-assets/.

**NOTE: This directory should be treated as read-only**; any files already here should not be changed or renamed, to avoid affecting historical Plunkers etc.
