This section shows how to add group footers to show group level totals.

## Enabling Group Footers

If you want to include a footer with each group, set the property `groupIncludeFooter` to true. It is also possible to
include a 'grand' total footer for all groups using the property `groupIncludeTotalFooter`.

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
    // adds subtotals
    groupIncludeFooter: true,
    // includes grand total
    groupIncludeTotalFooter: true,
}
```

Note that these properties can be used together to produce totals across all group levels.

The following example demonstrates these properties. Note the following:

* Expanding groups reveals subtotal footers as `groupIncludeFooter = true`.
* A grand total footer is shown as the `groupIncludeTotalFooter = true`.
* The medal totals are [aggregated](./aggregation/) via the `aggFunc: 'sum'` column property.

## Dynamic Group Footers

If you want a group footer to only be enabled for certain groups but not others, you can dynamically specify which groups to add footers for through passing a custom callback function to the property `groupIncludeFooter` instead of a boolean.

For example, to enable group footers for the second level of groups and groups with name 'France':

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
   // adds a group footer to the second level of groups and groups with name 'France'
   groupIncludeFooter: (params) => {
       const node = params.node;
       if (node && node.level === 1) return true;
       if (node && node.key === 'France') return true;
       return false;
   }
}
```

The following example demonstrates a custom group footer enablement. Note the following:

* Group Footer is shown for the second level of groups
* Group Footer is shown for the group called `France`
* No Group Footers are shown for any other groups.

### Example: Group Column Footers

To enable group footer for a particular row group column, you could do the following:

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
    // adds a group footer to rows grouped by the country column
    groupIncludeFooter: (params) => params.node.rowGroupColumn.getId() === 'country' 
}
```

The following example demonstrates a custom group footer enablement for rows grouped by a country column. Note the following:

* Group Footer is shown for rows grouped by the country column.
* Group Footer are not shown for any other groups

## Customising Footer Values

By default, the footer will display the word 'Total' followed by the group key. However, this can be changed using the
`footerValueGetter` supplied to the [Group Cell Renderer](./group-cell-renderer/) params as shown below:

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
    autoGroupColumnDef: { 
        cellRendererParams: {
            footerValueGetter: params =>  {
                const isRootLevel = params.node.level === -1;
                if (isRootLevel) {
                    return 'Grand Total';
                }
                return `Sub Total (${params.value})`;
            },
        }
    },
}
```

Note in the snippet above that the `footerValueGetter` contains special handling to display Subtotals and Grand Totals
differently. This is demonstrated in the example below.

## Customising Footer Cells

In most cases [Customising Footer Values](./grouping-footers/#customising-footer-values) is sufficient, however it is
also possible to customise the footer cell using the `innerCellRenderer` supplied to the
[Group Cell Renderer](./group-cell-renderer/) params as shown below:

In the example below the `innerRenderer` contains special handling to display Grand Total, Subtotal and
non-footer cells differently.

{% gridExampleRunner title="Customising Footer Cells" name="customising-footer-cells"  exampleHeight=503 /%}

{% note %}
It is also possible to customise footer cells using: `cellRendererParams.innerRendererSelector`. For more details see the [Group Cell Renderer](./group-cell-renderer/) section.

## Group Footer Limitations

Group footers are a UI concept only in the grid. It is the grids way of showing aggregated data (which belongs to the group) appearing after the group's children. Because the footer is a UI concept only, the following should be noted:

* It is not possible to select footer nodes. Footer rows appear selected when the group is selected.
* When exporting custom footers to Excel/CSV, the [processRowGroupCallback](./excel-export-customising-content/) function of the export must be used to export the custom values.
* When copying custom footers to the Clipboard, the [processCellForClipboard](./clipboard/#processing-individual-cells) function of the clipboard must be used to export the custom values.
