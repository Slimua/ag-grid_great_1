This section shows how to include group and grand total rows in the grid.

## Grand Total Row

To include a grand total row in the grid, set the property `grandTotalRow` to either 'top' or 'bottom', this determines
whether the grand total row will be included as the first or last row in the grid.

{% gridExampleRunner title="Enabling Grand Total Row" name="enabling-grand-total"  exampleHeight=503 /%}

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
    // adds subtotals to the bottom of each row group
    grandTotalRow: 'bottom',
}
```

## Group Total Rows

To include a total row in each group, set the property `groupTotalRow` to either 'top' or 'bottom', this determines
whether the total row will be included as the first or last row in the group.

{% gridExampleRunner title="Enabling Group Total Row" name="enabling-group-total"  exampleHeight=503 /%}

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
    // adds subtotals to the bottom of each row group
    groupTotalRow: 'bottom',
}
```

The following example demonstrates this property. Note the following:

* Expanding groups reveals subtotal rows at the bottom of each group as `groupTotalRow = 'bottom'`.
* The medal totals are [aggregated](./aggregation/) via the `aggFunc: 'sum'` column property.


### Dynamically Display Group Total Rows

To only display a group total row in some groups but not others, you can dynamically specify which groups to add the row
to by providing a callback function to the property `groupTotalRow` instead of 'top' or 'bottom'.

{% gridExampleRunner title="Customising Enabling Group Footers" name="customising-enabling-group-total-rows"  exampleHeight=588 /%}

The example above demonstrates custom group footers. Note the following:

* Group Total Row is shown for the second level of groups
* Group Total Row is shown for the group called `France`
* No Group Total Rows are shown for any other groups.

The code for implementing this behaviour is shown below:

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
   // adds a group total row at the bottom of the second level of groups, and groups with name 'France'
   groupTotalRow: (params) => {
       const node = params.node;
       if (node && node.level === 1) return 'bottom';
       if (node && node.key === 'France') return 'bottom';
       return undefined;
   }
}
```

## Customising Group Column Total Values

By default, the footer cell in the group column will display the word 'Total' followed by the group key. However, this can be changed using the
`totalValueGetter` supplied to the [Group Cell Renderer](./group-cell-renderer/) params as shown below:

```{% frameworkTransform=true %}
const gridOptions = {
    autoGroupColumnDef: { 
        cellRendererParams: {
            totalValueGetter: params =>  {
                const isRootLevel = params.node.level === -1;
                if (isRootLevel) {
                    return 'Grand Total';
                }
                return `Sub Total (${params.value})`;
            },
        }
    },
}
```

Note in the snippet above that the `totalValueGetter` contains special handling to display Subtotals and Grand Totals
differently. This is demonstrated in the example below.

{% gridExampleRunner title="Customising Footer Values" name="customising-footer-values"  exampleHeight=503 /%}

## Customising Group Total Cells

In most cases [Customising Group Column Values](./grouping-footers/#customising-group-column-total-values) is sufficient, however it is
also possible to customise the footer cell using the `innerCellRenderer` supplied to the
[Group Cell Renderer](./group-cell-renderer/) params as shown below:

In the example below the `innerRenderer` contains special handling to display Grand Total, Subtotal and
non-footer cells differently.

{% gridExampleRunner title="Customising Footer Cells" name="customising-footer-cells"  exampleHeight=503 /%}

{% note %}
It is also possible to customise footer cells using: `cellRendererParams.innerRendererSelector`. For more details see the [Group Cell Renderer](./group-cell-renderer/) section.

## Total Row Limitations

Group footers are a UI concept only in the grid. It is the grids way of showing aggregated data (which belongs to the group) appearing after the group's children. Because the footer is a UI concept only, the following should be noted:

* It is not possible to select footer nodes. Footer rows appear selected when the group is selected.
* When exporting custom footers to Excel/CSV, the [processRowGroupCallback](./excel-export-customising-content/) function of the export must be used to export the custom values.
* When copying custom footers to the Clipboard, the [processCellForClipboard](./clipboard/#processing-individual-cells) function of the clipboard must be used to export the custom values.
